## [1.0.0] - 2024-05-14

## Changed
- Use two files for versioning. `RELEASE` is next intended release, `VERSION`
  is automatically generated using `at version update`. To upgrade rename
  `VERSION` to `RELEASE` and make sure all builds (or other calls that rely on
  the `VERSION` file) are prepended with a call to `at version update`.
